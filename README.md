Weather Dashboard
Description
The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for the weather outlook of various cities and view both current and future weather conditions. It uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve the necessary weather data and localStorage to store search history, so users can quickly revisit their previous searches.

This dashboard is designed to assist travelers in planning trips based on weather forecasts. The user can view the current weather for a city and the 5-day weather forecast, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an icon representation of weather conditions.
